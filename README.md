## Installation

The easiest and preferred way is to install the `Xcode Command Line Tools`. From MacOS 10.9 you can:

1. open the `Terminal`
1. run `git --version`

If `git` is not installed already, a prompt will apper asking you to instal it.

Another method is to download the installer [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

### Win

The official build is available for download on the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/win). The download will start automatically. Git for Windows is different from `git` itself; if you want more information on it, vistit https://gitforwindows.org.

Additional info on how to install `git` can be found in the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
